## Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on CIFAR-10 Dataset

## Overview:
This project focuses on implementing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal was to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying images into one of ten predefined categories.

## Key Achievements:
Achieved an impressive 84% classification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Demonstrated proficiency in deep learning techniques, particularly in designing and training CNN architectures for image classification tasks.
Successfully utilized the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 color images across ten different classes, for model training and evaluation.

## Implementation Details:
Implemented a CNN architecture tailored to the CIFAR-10 dataset, comprising multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers for classification.
Employed data preprocessing techniques such as L2 regularization, dropout layers, batch normalization and data augmentation to enhance model performance and robustness.
Utilized techniques like mini-batch gradient descent and Adam optimization for efficient model training.
